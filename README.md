#Simple Midi

This repo creates a simple midi keyboard based on the sounds found in the `sounds` folder.

###Getting Started

*Note:* You must launch on a server. If using locally, I would recommend npm's [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

Put the sounds you want to trigger in the sounds folder. Refreshing the `index.html`, you will see the buttons are already created and the midi key bindings are already added to the buttons. These keybinginds are added in the order that your keyboard appears. ie `q,w,e ...o,p,a,s...k,l,z,x...` (only using letters)
